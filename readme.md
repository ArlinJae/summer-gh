hi tom/gh team,

firstly, it's a pleasure to meet you! thank you so much for taking the time out to read this. I understand this is an orthodox way of reaching out but I just thought you might appriciate it.


i'm reaching out to you to request a sit down with you in seattle sometime in March and also, a request to be able to worth with the eng team @ gh over the summer.


 a quick tl;dr of my background in the following - 
i got in trouble in high school for using reinforced learning to decrypt gov algos i wasn't supposed to be playing around with, realised i didn't really enjoy school and spent the next 5 years was the technical founder of two ai companies both of which i exited. i then did a brief stint doing prod + growth @ a series-a org which'd raised 12m (yc, sequoia, greylock, frc, etc) and sold to twitter + teamable and then a brief stint with a vc fund. 


last year, i quit my job and packed my bag to study software eng @ waterloo (in canada) with the goal to become as technical as possible. i believe working at gh would be a revolutionary way to achieve that goal. 


potential areas i'd like to dive deeper into/ teams i'd kill for the opportunity to work on - 
* cli tools
* ai/ml with gh copilot
* pm (tickets, pr-s, etc)
* codespaces, or more broadly - infra (admittedly, don't have much experiencehere but am a v. v. quick study)


(that being said, i feel like any org @ gh would increase my learning trajectory and would be greatly appriciated. just thought i should pen these categories down if it helps you direct me to the right ppl.)


thank you, have a great day ahead and i hopefully look forward to hearing back from you!
